The effect this has on survival and movement of adult rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) in this area is unknown. Additionally, fish movement during the spring has not been evaluated but may affect population estimates conducted in the tailwater monitoring area downstream from Island Park Dam prior to opening of fishing season. Therefore, we used radio telemetry to evaluate winter survival and movement of 61 adult rainbow trout in the Henrys Fork downstream from Island Park Dam under low and extremely low early winter flow conditions. Spring movement was also evaluated to asses whether the population estimates conducted in the monitoring area each spring represent fish from downstream adjacent reaches of the river, and how emigration between mark and recapture periods may affect the population estimate. Survival of radio-tagged trout was nearly 100 percent during early winter under both low and extremely low flow conditions and winter movement did not differ between the two years. Few radio-tagged rainbow trout from downriver were present in the monitoring reach during the time when the population estimate is normally conducted, indicating that large fluctuations in fish numbers in downstream reaches would likely be undetected based on population estimates conducted in the monitoring area. To remedy this, establishing a separate, regular population monitoring area in downstream reaches is recommended. We determined emigration from the monitoring reach between mark and recapture to have a minimal effect on the population estimate. However, we noted that all radio-tagged trout moving out of the monitoring reach during May moved into a short section of river between the monitoring reach and Island Park Dam, presumably to spawn. Therefore, emigration could be largely eliminated by extending the monitoring reach upstream to the dam.', NULL, '<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>The Henrys Fork of the Snake River contains a world-renowned wild rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) fishery from Island Park Dam downstream to Mesa Falls. Island Park Dam blocks fish passage and stores sediment that is occasionally released en mass (Van Kirk and Gamblin 2000), impacting spawning habitat (HabiTech 1994) and winter concealment habitat for age-0 trout (Gregory 2000). However, the most recurring impact to the fishery is the reduced winter flows that facilitate storage of irrigation water in Island Park Reservoir (Benjamin and Van Kirk 1999, Gregory 2000, Mitro et al. 2003). The number of juvenile rainbow trout that survive their first winter is directly related to the magnitude  of late winter flows from Island Park Dam (Mitro et al. 2003, Garren et al. 2004), but the effect of low winter flows on survival of adult trout in the Henrys Fork is unknown. Winter on the Henrys Fork has been defined as the period during which juvenile rainbow trout adopt concealment behavior (Smith and Griffith 1994). In our study area, this typically occurs from October to May (J. Gregory unpublished data). However, to parse actual winter movements from spawning related movement, we defined winter as that period from October through January.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the normally occurring low winter flows from Island Park Dam (~ 5.7 m<sup>3</sup>/s [200 cfs]), occasional dam repairs and past chemical treatments (see Van Kirk and Gamblin 2000) of the reservoir pool have necessitated complete termination of flow from Island Park Dam. When this occurs, the Henrys Fork is nearly dewatered for ~ 600 m from Island Park Dam to the Buffalo River, a spring-fed tributary that has a winter flow of ~ 5.7 m<sup>3</sup>/s (200 cfs). During these periods, the already altered low flow through much of the Henrys Fork is further reduced. These extremely low flow conditions only occur during early winter (Nov and Dec), when flows apparently do not regulate juvenile trout numbers (Mitro et al. 2003, Garren et al. 2004). However, the effect of extremely low flows on adult trout survival is unknown.</p>\r\n<p>Movement of adult rainbow trout in relation to low and extremely low winter flows and winter habitat availability in the Henrys Fork has not been previously studied. Winter concealment behavior has been observed in adult rainbow trout (Meyer and Gregory 2000) and enhances survival of juvenile rainbow trout in the Henrys  Fork (Smith and Griffith 1994, Meyer and Griffith 1997a, Mitro and Zale 2002). In fact, where cobble-boulder concealment habitat is absent, juvenile trout emigrate (Meyer and Griffith 1997a) or die (Smith and Griffith 1994) as juvenile trout numbers decline in areas lacking this habitat (Griffith and Smith 1995, Mitro and Zale 2002). Because Box Canyon contains the majority of the cobble-boulder habitat in the study area, most juvenile trout that survive their first winter do so in that stream section (Mitro and Zale 2002). If cobble-boulder concealment habitat is important for adult trout in the Henrys Fork, we would expect fall/early winter movements of adult trout into Box Canyon, but it is unknown if such movements occur.</p>\r\n<p>Rainbow trout spawning habitat in the study area is most abundant within the Box Canyon reach, which creates an interesting situation relative to springtime fish population monitoring conducted in this reach. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) conducts annual mark- recapture population estimates within Box Canyon before the fishing season opens in late May (Garren et al. 2008), which coincides with the rainbow trout spawning period. The estimates produced are thought to reflect population trends in Box Canyon and in downriver adjacent reaches of the Henrys Fork. However, how many rainbow trout from downstream reaches may be represented in those estimates because of movement to Box Canyon for either winter habitat, spawning, or other purposes, is unknown.</p>\r\n<p>Emigration, immigration, or mortality of rainbow trout during the springtime population estimate violates the assumption of a closed population. To minimize departure from a closed population, the mark and recapture events were typically separated by 7 days. We believe this relatively short time interval allows fish to redistribute themselves within the monitoring area, while avoiding excessive immigration and emigration (D. Garren, IDFG, personal communication). However, the extent of immigration and emigration within this time period in the monitoring area was unknown. Although mortality within the monitoring area during the sampling period was unknown, spawning- related mortality can be high for rainbow trout (Hartman et al. 1962). High mortality rates during spawning may again violate the assumptions of a closed population, i.e., no deaths occurred within the sampling period.</p>\r\n<p>The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate survival and movement of adult rainbow trout during typical and extremely low winter flows, 2) assess the extent to which rainbow trout from downstream reaches move into Box Canyon during the winter or spring and are represented in the population estimate, and 3) assess how rainbow trout movement and mortality between the mark and recapture periods may affect springtime population estimates.</p>\r\n<p>Understanding winter movement and mortality of adult rainbow trout in the Henrys Fork will help managers understand whether flow regimes devised to enhance survival of juvenile rainbow trout (Mitro et al. 2003) affect adult rainbow trout. Springtime movement patterns of adult trout will reveal the extent to which population trends observed in the monitoring area may represent fish from other reaches of the river. Furthermore, quantifying movement and mortality during the time when population sampling is conducted will help managers understand the validity and variability of population estimates.</p>\r\n \r\n<h3>Study Area</h3>\r\n<p>The Caldera Section of the Henrys Fork is about 47 km long and is located in eastern Idaho within the Island Park Caldera (Van Kirk and Benjamin 2000). Our study area was the upstream portion of that section and extended from Island Park Dam to the downstream boundary of Harriman State Park, a distance of 21.4 km (Fig 1).</p>\r\n<p>The river has a higher gradient, and has more available spawning habitat in the upstream reach (Box Canyon, 0.5%) and both gradient and availability of</p>\r\n \r\n<figure>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article1Figure1.jpg" alt="Figure1">\r\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Location of the Caldera Section of the Henrys Fork in eastern Idaho and the various reaches within the study area.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n \r\n<p>spawning habitat decrease incrementally in downstream reaches to Harriman East, which is characterized with a low gradient (0.1%) and fine substrates.</p>\r\n<p>The study area contains four tributaries that contain spawning habitat: the Buffalo River, along with Blue Spring, Thurmon, and Fish Creeks. The Buffalo River is blocked by a small hydroelectric project dam, about 200 m upstream from its mouth, which adult rainbow trout can pass by means of a fish ladder (Gregory 2000). Rainbow trout spawning habitat is present in the Buffalo River upstream from the dam, but is limited in Blue Spring Creek and the accessible portions of Thurmon and Fish creeks (Gregory 1998).</p>\r\n<p>The IDFG conducts population estimates nearly every May in a monitoring area within Box Canyon. The monitoring area begins at the mouth of the Buffalo River, 0.6 km downstream from Island  Park Dam, and extends 3.7 km downstream to the bottom of a riffle near the mouth of the canyon (Garren et al. 2008; Fig. 1). Population estimates (n = 10) from 1995 to 2006 of rainbow trout &#8805; 150 mm have a mean density of 1747 trout/km and have ranged from 1018 to 3471 trout/km or about a total of 3767 to 12,841 rainbow trout within the monitoring area in Box Canyon (Log-likelihood method; Garren et al. 2008). Brook trout (<em>Salvelinus fontinalis</em>) are present but rare and mountain whitefish (<em>Prosopium williamsoni</em>) are plentiful. The entire study area is managed with catch-and- release regulations for rainbow trout and is closed to fishing from December through late May.</p>\r\n<h3>Methods and Materials</h3>\r\n<p>Mortality and movement of rainbow trout in the Henrys Fork was evaluated by implanting radio transmitters into 61 adult rainbow trout during the fall, and tracking their movements through the following spring. The Henrys Fork in the study area was divided into five reaches (Fig. 1) of analogous habitat types (see Mitro and Zale 2002): Box Canyon (4.9 km), Last Chance (3.3 km), Upper Harriman (4.8 km), Lower Harriman (3.7 km) and Harriman East (4.7 km). In late October of water year 2004, we collected 11 rainbow trout from the Last Chance/ Upper Harriman Reach and 11 rainbow trout from the Lower Harriman Reach by drift-boat electrofishing. Trout were radio tagged and released at the downstream  ends of the Upper and Lower Harriman reaches, respectively. The following day, an additional 18 rainbow trout were collected immediately downstream from Island Park Dam by netting during a salvage operation, when flows from Island Park Dam were terminated to facilitate repairs to the outlet works. These fish were radio-tagged and released where water from the Buffalo River Hydroelectric Project enters the Henrys Fork, just upstream from the mouth of the Buffalo River. During November of water year 2005, an additional 21 fish were captured by hook-and-line throughout Box Canyon and were radio tagged and released at their capture locations.</p>\r\n<p>Radio transmitters were surgically implanted using a shielded-needle technique similar to Winter (1996) and Swanberg et al. (1999). Transmitters (Advanced Telemetry Systems model F1815, 3 volt, 12 mm diameter x 36 mm long, 7 g, 150 MHz) had a 30.5 cm trailing whip antenna and a mortality switch that was activated when they remained motionless for 24 hrs. Transmitters were programmed to turn   on for 12 hrs every 4 days. Radio transmitters and surgical instruments were sanitized prior to each surgery with either a betadine solution or isopropyl alcohol. Prior to surgery, fish were anesthetized with clove oil (Anderson et al. 1997) at a concentration of 60 mg/l, and were weighed and measured. Length of all radio-tagged trout ranged between 340 and 600 mm and weighed between 0.45 and 2.70 kg. Therefore, transmitter weight was always less than 2 percent of the fish''s body weight as suggested by Winter (1996). Surgeries were conducted by placing the fish upside down on a wooden trough-shaped operating table that was submerged in the above anesthetic solution. An incision (~15 mm long) was made anterior to the pelvic girdle and slightly removed from the fish''s mid-ventral line. An 18-gauge needle was then pushed through the body wall slightly posterior and laterally from the incision. The transmitter antenna was inserted into the incision and then pushed through the needle; the needle was then removed leaving the antenna extending through the hole made by the needle. The transmitter was then placed inside the body cavity and moved posterior by pulling gently on the antenna. The incision was closed with stainless steel staples (Swanberg et al. 1999) and/or sutures. Fish were observed until the effects of the anesthetic had subsided, and were then released.</p>\r\n<p>Radio-tagged fish were relocated about once every month from the time of tagging until early March. Thereafter, fish were relocated every 4 days until the end of May, and then twice a month throughout the summer and fall. Tracking ended in mid-July 2005. Fish were tracked with an Advanced Telemetry Systems R2100 receiver while either floating the river or following it along the bank. Tracking began at Island Park Dam and proceeded downstream through Lower Harriman and sometimes through Harriman East. Fish locations were recorded relative to Global Positioning System (GPS) reference points along the river. GPS reference points were spaced about 400 m apart in Box Canyon with this spacing increasing to 700 m downstream from Box Canyon. When fish were located near reach breaks or the monitoring area boundaries, care was taken to determine which reach they were in and whether or not they were within the monitoring area. When a mortality signal was encountered the fish was recorded as deceased and the tag was recovered, if possible. Fish that died within four weeks of tag implantation were assumed to be the result of handling and surgery.</p>\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n<p>Survival of radio-tagged trout during the winter was high during both years.</p>\r\n<p>All fish radio-tagged in Box Canyon survived the early winter period (Nov and Dec) both during extremely low flows (water year 2004) and during the same period of low flows the following water year (Fig. 2). Additionally, late-winter (Jan - Mar) survival of radio-tagged fish was 100 percent for fish that experienced extremely low early winter flows (water year 2004) and was > 80 percent for fish that experienced low early winter flows the following year. Winter survival of radio- tagged fish downstream from Box Canyon was also high; two fish were considered tagging mortalities and the remaining 20 survived through mid-March (Fig. 2).</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article1Figure2.jpg" alt="Figure1">\r\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Survival of radio-tagged rainbow trout collected downstream from Box Canyon during water year (WY) 2004 and in Box Canyon during (WY) 2004 and 2005 relative to discharge at Island Park Dam during (WY) 2004 and 2005.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n \r\n<p>Aside from redistribution movements immediately after tagging, trout movement among fish tagged in Box Canyon was similar during the extremely low flow period and during a corresponding time period the following year. Movements between tracking periods for radio-tagged trout during this period (Nov and Dec) averaged about 0.5 km and ranged from 0 to 2.9 km. Redistribution movements following tagging differed between years.  In water year 2004, salvaged fish redistributed themselves rather quickly following tagging. These fish dispersed downstream through Box Canyon within one month (average movement 1.2 km, range 0 to 4.4 km) where they spent the winter, and they did not immediately return to their capture location when water was again released from the dam on 26 December. In water year 2005, a similar redistribution movement was not observed, but rather most fish remained near their capture location (average movement 0.5 km, range 0.0-5.0 km).</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Fish tagged in the upper and lower Harriman reaches moved back upstream into the areas from which they were captured within one month, and 15 of 20 were never observed downstream from their release location. Most of the radio-tagged trout from the Last Chance and Harriman reaches did not migrate to Box Canyon before February. The exception to this was one fish that spent the winter immediately downstream from Box Canyon and was located in the lower end of Box Canyon during a single tracking period in December.</p>\r\n<p>Radio-tagged trout from downstream reaches made apparent spawning migrations into the population monitoring area from February through May (Fig. 3), but because movements were staggered and some of those fish moved back out of the monitoring area before May, not all of those fish would have been represented in a population estimate. Throughout this period, radio- tagged fish of all size classes tagged moved to the monitoring area from the Last Chance</p>\r\n \r\n<figure>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article1Figure3.jpg" alt="Figure1">\r\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Percentage of radio-tagged adult rainbow trout present in each section of the study area throughout water year 2004.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n \r\n<p>Upper Harriman reaches (2 of 10) and the Lower Harriman Reach (4 of 10). However, during any given 8-day period in May 2004, during which a population estimate could have been conducted, 6 to 12 percent of fish radio-tagged downstream from Box Canyon were present in the monitoring area. Most of the radio-tagged fish that survived through May returned to their pre-spawning location by June. Most of the radio-tagged fish (11 of 16) that were salvaged immediately below Island Park Dam during water year 2004, returned to their pre-capture location during the apparent spawning period.</p>\r\n<p>All of the fish tagged in Box Canyon during water year 2005 were within the population monitoring area during the first tracking period in May (Fig. 4). During any given 8-day period of May, 8 to 23 percent of those fish moved upstream, out of the population monitoring area, and none moved downstream out of the monitoring area. All of these trout were > 400 mm. No radio- tagged rainbow trout died in the monitoring area during May. However, one radio-tagged trout that had moved upstream out of the monitoring area in May then died 8-12 days later in its new location.</p>\r\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Radio-tagged adult rainbow trout winter survival and movement was similar during low and extremely low flow years. Winter survival of radio-tagged rainbow trout in our study was nearly 100 percent, suggesting  that even extremely low winter flows do not limit adult trout numbers in the study area at contemporaneous densities (1197 trout &#8805; 150 mm/km in the Box Canyon monitoring area; see Garren et al. 2008). Therefore, adult trout survival is not affected by the Island Park Dam current operating procedure of releasing less water in early winter in exchange for more water later in the winter, which increases survival of juvenile rainbow trout (Mitro et al. 2003). One caveat to this assertion is that survival could be negatively impacted if air temperatures drop to the point that ice formation occurs. While shelf ice provides concealment habitat for juvenile</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article1Figure4.jpg" alt="Figure1">\r\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Percentage of radio-tagged adult rainbow trout present in each section of the study area throughout water year 2005.</figcaption>\r\n</figure> \r\n \r\n<p>and adult trout and can cause them to be less reliant on other types of concealment cover (Gregory and Griffith 1996, Jakober et al. 1998), frazil ice (Simpkins et al. 2000) and anchor ice (Chisholm et al. 1987, Jakober et al. 1998, Lindstrom and Hubert 2004) can reduce habitat suitability and result in emigration of fish which may increase mortality. Water released from the hypolimnion of Island Park Reservoir and tributary inflows from the spring-fed Buffalo River typically keep Box Canyon free of ice. However, the resulting open water facilitates formation of frazil ice and anchor ice in downstream reaches (Last Chance and Harriman) of the study area. This frazil ice can adhere to macrophytes causing rapid macrophyte sloughing (Griffith and Smith 1995, Simpkins et al. 2000) effectively reducing concealment habitat for juvenile and likely adult trout (Heggenes et al. 1993) at a time when conditions for trout movement are most severe.</p>\r\n<p>Our observations that survival of adult rainbow trout in the Henrys Fork does not appear to be affected by low winter flows is consistent with those of Sutton et al. (2000) who found no clear demonstrable effect of low winter flows on health of rainbow trout in the San Juan River downstream from Navajo Dam. Furthermore, McKinney et al. (2001) suggested that in the Colorado River downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, small rainbow trout were more strongly influenced by physical factors, such as winter flow, than were large trout. This also seems to be the case in our study area (Mitro et al. 2003, Garren et al. 2004, this study). Given this, we suggest that consideration of juvenile rainbow trout needs may be more important than the needs of adult rainbow trout in formulating winter flow regimes below hypolimnetic release dams. However, additional research is needed to assess this hypothesis in other areas and to determine how it may change in areas further downstream from dams, where stream habitat conditions may be more affected by ice.</p>\r\n<p>Average winter movements for radio- tagged trout in Box Canyon between tracking periods were 0.7 km. These movements are much larger than winter movements observed for rainbow trout (Gido, et al. 2000) and cutthroat trout (<em>Oncorhynchus clarkii</em>) (Jakober et al. 1998) in other areas. The stationing of our reference GPS points along the stream could have caused movements to appear magnified. However, the studies outlined above reported a general lack of winter movement for trout, which is contrary to what we observed. Radio-tagged trout in this study may have moved more often because of the relatively moderate winter water temperatures resulting from hypolimnetic releases from Island Park Dam and inflow from the spring-fed Buffalo River.</p>\r\n<p>Radio-tagged fish in our study did not make late-fall or winter migrations among study reaches. Trout migration to wintering areas has been observed in other rivers (Meka 2003), whereas lack of migration to wintering areas suggests that adequate winter habitat was available in reaches where trout also spend the summer (Young 1998). Some radio-tagged fish in our study over-wintered in areas containing minimal small woody debris or cobble-boulder habitat (Last Chance through Harriman East), even though adult rainbow trout have been observed to utilize these structures for concealment during winter days in nearby rivers (Meyer and Gregory 2000). However, other winter habitat features were available in these reaches including submerged aquatic macrophytes and deep pools. These habitat types have also been observed to provide winter cover for adult trout (Heggenes et al. 1993, Cunjak 1996).</p>\r\n<p>Few rainbow trout from downstream reaches are represented in the population estimate that takes place in the monitoring area each spring. Assuming that the movements of our radio-tagged fish are representative of similarly sized untagged trout, between 6 and 12 percent of the ~ 1700 fish > 300 mm present in 2008 from Last Chance through Lower Harriman (IDFG unpublished data) could be expected to be present in the monitoring area when the population estimate is typically completed. This would mean that 102-204 fish from downstream would be represented in the population estimate.\r\nThe estimated number of fish in the Box Canyon monitoring area fluctuates between 3,700 and 12,900 fish > 150 mm (Garren\r\net al. 2008). Therefore, immigrating trout from down-river could represent 0.7 to 5.4 percent of the estimated number of trout in Box Canyon.</p>\r\n<p>Because migrant fish from downstream are a small portion of the Box Canyon population estimate, downstream fish numbers could fluctuate widely (maybe even by a factor of 10) and independently of Box Canyon fish numbers and not be noticed. For example, if the total Box Canyon population estimate were low, e.g., 4,000 fish, and the fish numbers from downstream increased by a factor of ten, then instead of 200 fish from downstream reaches moving into the monitoring area, 2000 fish could have moved to that area. This would result in an increase in the population estimate from 4000 fish to 6000 fish, a 50-percent increase, but it is unlikely to suggest to managers that fish numbers downstream have increased 10-fold. When fish numbers in Box Canyon are high, fluctuations in fish numbers downstream would be even more obscured. Fish numbers in Box Canyon and areas downstream likely fluctuate together based on some factors such as drought (Erman 1986, Binns 1994), but also may fluctuate independently based on changes in macrophyte abundance, which are an important component of trout habitat downstream from Box Canyon but not in Box Canyon (Van Kirk and Martin 2000). Given the dynamic changes recently observed in macrophyte density and  species composition (Van Kirk and Martin 2000, Henry 2010) in the Last Chance and Harriman reaches, regular trout population estimates within that area are needed to reflect fish population trends in those reaches.</p>\r\n<p>Between 8 and 23 percent of our radio- tagged rainbow trout moved upstream out of the monitoring area during any given 8-day period in May 2005, however, it does not necessarily follow that the same proportion of all sizes of untagged fish moved out of the monitoring area. The movement we observed likely reflects spawning movements, which would be expected to involve only the mature adult portion (> 400 mm) of the population. The lack of movement out of the monitoring area by radio-tagged fish < 400 mm supports this hypothesis. In 2005, fish > 400 mm made up 41 percent of rainbow trout captured in the monitoring area (IDFG unpublished data). Therefore, maximum upstream spawning emigration may involve 9 percent of the total population, which is the 23 percent maximum observed emigration rate of radio tagged fish x 41 percent of fish in the population that are > 400 mm and therefore likely to move upstream.</p>\r\n<p>An accurate population estimate for the marking period is based on two assumptions 1) no births or immigration between the mark and recapture periods, and 2) deaths and emigration between those periods  affects marked and unmarked fish equally (Gatz and Loar 1988). Therefore, if these assumptions were met, the actual population estimate of 4430 (95% confidence interval 3922-4937) rainbow trout > 150 mm in the monitoring site during 2005 (Garren et al. 2008) should accurately portray the fish present during the marking period. To assess if emigration may have affected the estimate, and therefore what the estimated population would be during the recapture period (after the emigration had occurred), we removed 19 marked fish (23% of the marked fish > 400 mm) from the analysis and calculated a new hypothetical population estimate using the same log-likelihood estimator used by Garren et al. (2008). These calculations yielded a hypothetical population estimate  of 4369 (95% confidence interval 3863- 4874) rainbow trout > 150 mm. These two estimates are not significantly different as evidenced by their overlapping confidence intervals.</p>\r\n<p>Sources of potential error, besides emigration, exist in the population estimate conducted in the monitoring area each spring. While this study showed that immigration from downriver into the monitoring area is relatively small, we do not know the extent of immigration into the monitoring area from the area between Island Park Dam and the mouth of the Buffalo River, upstream from the monitoring area. Additionally, even though no radio- tagged trout died in Box Canyon during May, a few untagged fish may experience spawning related mortality within the monitoring area during this time period.</p>\r\n<p>The primary use of the population estimate for management purposes is not to identify the absolute number of\r\nindividuals per se, but rather to compare the population estimate obtained with previous and subsequent population estimates\r\nto determine whether the population is increasing or decreasing. These comparisons will be biased if detection probabilities are differentially affected by such things as emigration; subsequently, statistical tests should be run to determine if detection probabilities are equal among comparison years (MacKenzie and Kendall 2002).</p>\r\n<p>Based on our study, there may be a relatively easy way to eliminate some of the potential effects of detection probabilities from emigration. During May, migration from the monitoring area by radio-tagged rainbow trout only included movements upstream, into the area between Island Park Dam and the mouth of the Buffalo River. Therefore, this emigration from the monitoring area could be eliminated by extending the monitoring area upstream to Island Park Dam. However, this may cause additional problems such as estimates from the extended monitoring area may not be comparable to estimates from the current monitoring area because fish density may be higher in the added area. Also, the additional time necessary to sample fish in the extended area may result in fewer marking runs being completed, ultimately expanding confidence intervals and making changes in the population more difficult to detect. Another way to eliminate some effects of fish movement or mortality is to conduct the population estimate during the fall when emigration and mortality rates are lower than during the spawning period. However, this is a popular fishery and conducting estimates during the fishing season could be socially unacceptable. After 30 November, when the fishing season has ended, discharge from Island Park Dam is reduced to facilitate storage of irrigation water and is typically too low to conduct an estimate.</p>\r\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\r\n<p>&#8226;	Survival of radio tagged trout in Box Canyon during early winter was 100 percent at low and extremely low flows.</p>\r\n<p>&#8226;	Consideration of juvenile trout needs may be more important in formulating winter flow regimes below hypolimnetic release dams than are the needs of adult trout.</p>\r\n<p>&#8226;	Trout movement among radio-tagged rainbow trout in Box Canyon was similar during the extremely low flow period and during a corresponding time period the following year.</p>\r\n<p>&#8226;	Trout from downstream reaches are present in Box Canyon during May, when population estimates are conducted, but these fish are a small proportion of the overall estimated population.

Our study was initiated to gather data on the distribution of bat species found in the southwestern part of the state. We captured 106 individuals of eight bat species in mist-nets at 15 water sources in southwestern Montana during July through August 2003-2006. The western long-eared myotis (<em>Myotis evotis</em>) was the most frequently captured species and detected at over half the sites surveyed. Other common species captured across numerous sites included little brown myotis (<em>M. lucifugus</em>), hoary bats (<em>Lasiurus cinereus</em>), and big brown bats (<em>Eptesicus fuscus</em>). These species are apparently broadly distributed throughout southwestern Montana, occurring in a variety of habitat types. Our study provides some much needed baseline data on bat distribution in southwestern Montana.\r\n', NULL, '<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Bats are important components of terrestrial ecosystems (Fenton 1997). They have low reproductive rates for mammals their size (Hill and Smith 1984), which makes their populations slow to recover from high levels of mortality. Thus, potential for factors such as habitat alteration, environmental change, and more recently white nose syndrome (Blehert et al. 2009) to cause declines in bat abundance has led to a focus on bats by many natural resource agencies. However, data necessary to develop effective conservation plans for bat species are often lacking. Even such basic information as species distribution is not available for many locations (Saugey 1991, Pierson 1998).</p>\r\n<p>In Montana, published records on bat species distribution and abundance are limited and cover only parts of the state. Nicholson (1950) provided the first record of a spotted bat (<em>Euderma maculatum</em>) found in a home in Billings. Swenson (1970) published data on distribution of the western small-footed myotis (<em>Myotis ciliolabrum</em>) in eastern Montana. Hoffman et al. (1969) made the first attempt to summarize distribution of numerous bat species in the state based on specimens collected by the Public Health Service for rabies work  in the late 1950s through the 1960s. The majority of these collected bats came from Missoula and Ravalli counties in western Montana. The work of Jones et al. (1973), Lampe et al. (1974), and Shryer and Flath (1980) added information on bats present in Carbon County in southeastern Montana. Swenson and Bent (1977) provided a list of species present in Yellowstone County in south-central Montana while Swenson and Shanks (1979) documented bats at three sites in northeastern Montana. Most recently Hendricks et al. (2000) documented species present in the Little Rocky Mountains of the north-central part of the state. Published data on presence of bat species in other parts of Montana is still limited. Our study was initiated to gather preliminary data on the distribution of bat species found in the southwestern part of the state.</p>\r\n<h3>Study Area</h3>\r\n<p>This study was conducted in southwestern Montana on USDI Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holdings of the Butte Field Office. These holdings are located in Jefferson, Broadwater, Lewis and Clark, and Silver Bow Counties. Bats were surveyed at 15 different sites located across these holdings. Sites were selected based on their accessibility and the presence of permanent water sources. Elevations at these sites ranged from ~ 1300 m to 2100 m. To examine patterns of distribution  by different bat species, we classified each survey site into 4 habitat types: S = water sources surrounded by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), D = water sources surrounded by Douglas- fir (<em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>), C= streams lined with large deciduous trees such as cottonwood (<em>Populus spp.</em>), or quaking aspen (<em>Populus tremuloides</em>), W = streams lined with riparian shrubs (predominately <em>Salix</em> spp.).</p>\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n<p>This study was conducted during mid July-early August, 2003-2006. At each site, we captured bats using 36-mm mesh, 50 denier, 2.1-m x 5.4-m mist-nets placed in locations considered to be suitable flyways for bats, such as open pools of water or clearings in stands of trees. The number of nets used per site varied but ranged from two to four. Nets were opened ~ 1 hr before sunset and kept open for 3-5 hrs depending on activity. Captured bats were identified to species and data on body measurements, sex, reproductive condition of females, and age (juvenile vs. adult) were recorded.    We assessed reproductive condition by examination of the lower abdomen and mammary glands (Racey 1988). We aged bats based upon the degree of epiphyseal- diaphyseal fusion of wing bones (Anthony 1988). We identified species based on published keys and species accounts (van Zyll de Jong 1985, Adams 2003, Nagorsen and Brigham 1993). Western long-eared myotis (<em>M. evotis</em>) and fringed myotis (<em>M. thysanodes</em>) were distinguished from one another by ear length (van Zyll de Jong 1985). Specifically, the western long-eared myotis has an overall ear length that exceeds 50 percent of the forearm length and when the ear on the western long-eared myotis is pressed forward it extends &#8805;10 mm beyond the tip of the nose (van Zyll de Jong 1985). All captured bats were released after handling. Handling procedures were approved by Montana Fish,Wildlife, and Parks.</p>\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n<p>We identified a total of 106 individuals of eight species from 15 water sources in 22 trap nights from southwestern Montana (Table 1). Survey effort varied by site. The majority of sites were only surveyed once but several sites were surveyed twice and one site was surveyed five times (Appendix A).</p>\r\n<p>Western long-eared myotis and fringed myotis were the most abundant species captured, each made up over 20 percent of total captures. The western long-eared myotis was the most broadly distributed species within the study region (Tables 1 and 2).</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article2Table1.jpg" alt="Table 1 Number of bats captured by species from Southwestern Montana, July-August, 2003-2006.">\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article2Table2.jpg" alt="Table 2 Occurrence of bat species by locality (see Appendix 1) and habitat type (S = water sources surrounded by sagebrush (<em>Artemisia</em> spp.), D = water sources surrounded by Douglas- fir (<em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>), C= streams lined with large deciduous trees such as cottonwood (<em>Populus</em> spp.), or quaking aspen (<em>Populus tremuloides</em>), W = streams lined with riparian shrubs (predominately Salix spp.) for each species in southwestern Montana , July-August 2003 - 2006.">\r\n<br>\r\n<p>This species was captured at over 50 percent of the sites surveyed and occurred in all habitat types at elevations ranging from 1470 m to 1770 m (Appendix A). Other broadly distributed species included hoary bats (<em>Lasiurus cinereus</em>) and big brown bats (<em>Eptesicus fuscus</em>), both of which were captured at 40 percent of sites. Hoary bats were captured in all habitat types while big brown bats were captured in three of the four. While relatively high numbers of fringed myotis were captured, the majority of these individuals (73%) were all captured at one site (Appendix A). Western small- footed myotis (<em>M. ciliolabrum</em>) and silver- haired bats (<em>Lasionycteris noctivagans</em>) were the least abundant species captured, but even though few individuals of these species were captured they were captured across multiple sites, habitats, and elevations.</p>\r\n<p>Almost 80 percent of individual bats captured were males (Table 1). For all species, with the exception of long- legged myotis (<em>M. volans</em>) close to twice\r\nas many males compared to females were captured. No female fringed myotis were captured at any of the survey sites. Of the small number of female bats that were captured (N = 24), the majority (67%) were reproductive (lactating) at the time of capture. The percentage of lactating females ranged from 0% for hoary bats (N = 3) and western small-footed myotis (N = 1) to 100 percent for silver-haired bats (N = 1) and big brown bats (N = 2). Percentage of captured females that were lactating was 83, 83, and 33 percent for long-legged myotis, western long-eared myotis, and little brown mytois, respectively. Females were captured at elevations ranging from 1340 m to 1780 m (Appendix A).</p>\r\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>We recorded the presence of 8 bat species at 15 sites in southwestern Montana. Fifteen bat species occur in Montana with   12 of these species believed to be distributed in the western part of the state (Foresman 2001). The four species believed to be present in this part of the state that we did not capture were townsend''s big-eared bat (<em>Corynorhinus townsendii</em>), spotted bat, California myotis (<em>M. californicus</em>), and Yuma myotis (<em>M. yumanensis</em>). Echolocation calls of spotted bats are audible to the human ear, allowing species recognition without direct capture (Leonard and Fenton 1983).\r\nHowever, we did not audibly detect this species during any of our surveys. Montana is the north-eastern-most extension of the range of both California myotis and Yuma myotis (Foresman 2001) and it may be that both species are uncommon in the western part of the state. However, others (Hoffmann et al. 1969) have found California myotis to be relatively common in the Bitterroot Valley in far western Montana. Townsend''s big-eared bats have been documented in the\r\ncounties that we surveyed (Foresman 2001). This species is found in a variety of habitats but it exists in low densities throughout its range (Humphrey and Kunz 1976, Kunz and Martin 1982). Townsend''s big-eared bats are also known to be highly maneuverable and agile fliers (Fellers and Pierson 2002) which make them difficult to capture in mist-nets. It is likely that they may have been present at some of the sites we surveyed but a greater survey effort would be needed to detect them (Weller and Lee 2007).</p>\r\n<p>Fringed myotis were captured at three sites. This species is one of the six bat species designated as Sensitive by the Montana State Office of the BLM and one\r\nof six species listed by the state as a Species of Concern. It has previously been collected in lower elevation forest regions in the state (Foresman 2001). We captured only males of this species and only at the high end of the range of elevations we surveyed. Many studies have reported elevational differences in distribution among sexes of insectivorous bats (Fenton et al. 1980, Grindal et al. 1999, Cryan et al. 2000) with females occurring at lower elevations.</p>\r\n<p>Thorough knowledge of the current distribution of any species is necessary to maintain existing populations. This study contributes some important preliminary information on bat distribution in southwestern Montana and identifies sites that may be useful for future studies. However, much work remains to be done. Activity patterns of bats have been found to vary both spatially and temporally (Hayes 1997, 2000) and it is likely that our surveys did not detect all bat species present at individual sites. More surveys and multiple surveys at individual sites are recommended as well as studies that focus on roost and foraging site selection.</p>\r\n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>\r\n<p>We thank Cheryl Schmidt, Shauna Marquardt, and Joel Tigner for assistance in the field.

In our long-term study, we found that deer mice were more abundant at a live-trapping grid with greater rock cover, than two grids with less rock cover. There was a non-significant trend (P = 0.053) for deer mice to be more abundant in rocky sites in the short term study. In the long-term study, average SNV antibody prevalence among deer mice was slightly greater (5.0 vs. 3.5 % on average) at the live trapping grid with more rock cover, than the grid with less rock cover. We were unable to demonstrate differences in SNV antibody prevalence among treatments in the short-term study. Further studies are needed to elucidate the multiple determinants of deer mouse abundance and SNV prevalence in grassland ecosystem and other habitat types.</p>\r\n', NULL, '<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<p>The abundance of small mammals varies temporally and spatially among and within habitat types (e.g., Krebs, 1996). In many cases, however, the underlying determinants of variability in small  mammal abundance are unknown. Variation in abundance can have consequences for pathogen transmission because host abundance may influence contact and transmission rates among individuals in a population (Keeling and Rohani 2008). For example, human incidence of nephropathia epidemica (caused by <em>Puumala hantavirus</em>) was related to abundance of the host <em>Clethrionomys glareolus</em> in Sweden (Niklasson et al., 1995). Studies that examine determinants of host abundance in nature, and the effects these factors may have on pathogen prevalence, are needed to help reduce human exposure.</p>\r\n<p>Deer mice (<em>Peromyscus maniculatus</em>) are widespread omnivorous rodents, which occur in a variety of habitat types across North America (Kirkland and Layne 1989, Douglass et al. 2001). These rodents have been ideal organisms for studies of habitat relationships for many decades (e.g.,  Smith 1940, Douglass 1989, Matlack et al. 2001, Johnston and Anthony 2008) and in Montana their abundance varies among and within many habitat types (e.g., Douglass  et al. 2001). Deer mouse abundance has been found to be positively related to shrub cover in a short grass prairie environment (Stapp and Van Horne 1997) throughout central and western Montana (Douglass 1989a, Douglass et al. 2001) and Western Colorado (Douglass 1989b). Furthermore, deer mice are reservoirs for Sin Nombre virus (SNV, <em>Bunyaviridae:Hantavirus</em>) (Nichol et al., 1993), a directly transmitted zoonotic pathogen that is transmissible to humans causing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), which has a high mortality rate (CDC, 2009). The abundance of deer mice is an important component of SNV transmission (e.g., Madhav et al. 2007) and human exposure risk (Childs et al. 1995). Both abundance of deer mice and SNV prevalence among mice can vary significantly over small spatial scales (Glass et al. 2000, Douglass et al. 2001). Therefore, studies that investigate variability in deer mouse abundance and how this is affected by habitat characteristics within an expansive habitat type are of value to understanding SNV transmission and human exposure risk.</p>\r\n<p>In Montana deer mouse abundance and prevalence of antibodies to SNV are on average highest in sagebrush (<em>Artemesia tridentata</em>) dominated environments (Douglass et al. 2001), where sagebrush itself may provide retreat sites. However, deer mice can also be abundant, with high SNV antibody prevalence in other habitat types, such as grassland and forest environments (Kuenzi et al. 2001, Douglass et al., 2001). Here, we investigated how abundance of deer mice and prevalence of SNV antibodies varied within a grassland ecosystem located in Cascade County, Montana. We focused on rock cover, which may be an indicator of potential retreat site availability, as a determinant of variation in deer mouse abundance in this habitat type. Within this grassland several habitat characteristics were different among sampling locations and some, e.g., such as shrubs or patches of tall grass, may provide retreat sites for deer mice. However, we chose to focus on rock cover in this study because the abundance of deer mice at three long-term grassland live trapping grids differed (Douglass et al. 2001) as did rock cover. In addition, we frequently observed deer mice using rocks as retreat sites upon release from live traps. Although rock cover is clearly not critical to deer mouse survival in all habitats especially in open environments with high shrub cover (Douglass et al. 2001, Douglass 1989a, Douglass 1989b, Douglass and Frisina 1993), in this environment rock cover may be important for avoiding large predators, caching resources, or nesting. Other habitat characteristics differed among our long-term live trapping grids (see results) and likely also contributed to variation in deer mouse abundance within this grassland habitat type (Wecker 1963, Douglass 1989a, Douglass 1989b, Morris, 1997). The multivariate effect of habitat characteristics on deer mouse abundance will be the subject of further investigations.</p>\r\n<p>We hypothesized that in a specific type of Northern Great Plain grassland, deer mice are more abundant, with a greater number of individuals and prevalence of SNV antibodies in the population, in sites with similar vegetative characteristics but greater rock cover (potential retreat site availability) than sites with less rock cover. We investigated the relationship between population abundance and prevalence of SNV in relation to rock cover in two ways. We used a long-term (1994-2010) study on population dynamics of deer mice on three live trapping grids and prevalence of SNV on two live trapping grids (Douglass et al. 1996, Douglass et al. 2001) from which our observations led to the hypothesis above. Because the long-term study lacked spatial replication in rock cover, we also undertook a short-term (three month) spatially- replicated study to evaluate the effect of rock cover on small mammal abundance.</p>\r\n<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>\r\n<h4>Long-term data collection</h4>\r\n<p>Data on deer mice and habitat characteristics were collected on three one hectare grids (grid numbers 10, 11 and 12) located near Cascade (46&#176; 59.3 N, 111&#176; 35.3 W, 1408 m AMS), Montana. Grids  were situated in grassland habitat supporting an active cattle ranch (Douglass et al., 1996). We live-trapped deer mice for three consecutive nights/month on all three 1-ha grids for 174 consecutive months between June 1994 and November 2008. Trapping grids consisted of 100 equally-spaced Sherman live traps (H. B. Sherman Traps. Tallahassee, Florida), baited with rolled oats and peanut butter and provisioned with polyester Fiberfil bedding. Upon capture, each rodent was given a uniquely numbered ear-tag (model #1005-1, National Band and Tag Co., Newport, KY) and species, gender, body mass, reproductive condition, and presence of scars or wounds were recorded. We routinely collected blood samples, which were later tested for antibodies to SNV, from grids 11 and 12 only. We followed animal handling, blood collection and safety precautions described by Mills et al. (1995) and approved by the University of Montana IACUC. Serological testing was performed at the Montana State Public Health Laboratory and at Special Pathogens Branch, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using methods described by Feldmann et al. (1993).</p>\r\n<p>We used the enumeration technique of Chitty and Phipps (1966) to provide a minimum number of individuals known to be alive (MNA) during a 3-day trapping session as an index of population abundance for each month. The minimum number of deer mice antibody-positive to SNV (MNI) during each trap session was calculated in the same way for grids 11 and 12. Estimated antibody prevalence (EAP) of deer mice for a given month was calculated by dividing MNI by MNA (Mills et al. 1999a).</p>\r\n<p>Data on habitat characteristics of the three long-term grids were collected twice annually (Jun and Sep) at 25 randomly- assigned locations/grid using a 10-pin point frame. Percent cover of lichens mosses, grass, forbs, shrubs, rock, leaf litter and bare ground was determined at each location. A contact with rock and a point frame rod was counted as rock cover. Although, direct use of rocks as retreat sites by deer mice was not quantified in this study, our assumption of rocks offering retreat sites seemed reasonable. Although our analysis did not directly account for use of rocks as retreat sites we found (1) large rocks that mice were able to move beneath were present at all sites, (2) small burrows were common around rocks at our sites, (3) mice were frequently observed retreating to rocks for cover when released from traps, and (4) mouse tracks and burrows in snow commonly originated from rocks.</p>\r\n<h4>Short-term Data Collection</h4>\r\n<p>To determine if abundance of deer mice differed among sites with more or less rock cover (retreat sites), we established  six 0.25-ha grids on three slopes (named Hill One, Hill Two and Hill Three for this study) of approximately the same elevation and aspect. Within each slope, one grid was located in a rocky area and one in a non-rocky area. Grids were live-trapped for small mammals monthly from August-October 2008 in the same manner as the long-term live trapping grids, but with 25 equally spaced rather than 100 Sherman live-capture traps. Small mammal handling, testing for SNV antibodies, calculation of MNA, MNI rock cover, and SNV prevalence among deer mice was carried out in the same manner as the long-term trapping grids. In September, we also measured habitat characteristics at each of the six grids in the same way as the long-term grids, but with habitat characteristics determined from six randomly-assigned locations at each grid (a similar proportion/unit area as the long-term grids).</p>\r\n<h3>Analyses</h3>\r\n<p>We employed a Friedman analysis (Zar, 1996) to determine if abundance of deer mice, number of deer mice antibody positive for SNV, and antibody prevalence among deer mice differed among long- term trapping grids. A Friedman analysis was also used to determine if habitat characteristics differed among the long-term grids over time. Friedman analysis enabled examination of direction of differences among variables for individual sampling occasions collectively and, accordingly, was independent of the effects of seasonal and climatic forcing on dynamics, which are certainly important but beyond the scope of this investigation. For the short- term study, habitat characteristics among grids were compared using a Generalized Linear Model (GZLM), with hillside as a random effect. Optimal distribution and transformation of data (Poisson or negative binomial probability distribution and identity or log-link function respectively) for the GZLM were specified using an Omnibus test. A linear mixed model (LMM) was used to determine if deer mouse abundance and antibodies to SNV among deer mice (number antibody positive and antibody prevalence) differed between rocky and non-rocky sites, with month as a repeated measure and hillside as a random effect. All analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, U.S.).</p>\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n<p>Over the 15-yr long-term study, we captured 4458 individual deer mice 12,265 times in 155,700 trap-nights of effort. Abundance of deer mice fluctuated among months and years. Average monthly abundance of deer mice was greatest at grid 11 (MNA = 25.8), least at grid 12 (MNA= 15.3), and intermediate at grid 10 (MNA= 22.9) (Table 1). The average monthly number of antibody positive deer mice (MNI) and estimated antibody prevalence (EAP) was greater at grid 11 (MNI = 1.3, EAP = 0.05) than grid 12 (MNI = 0.3, EAP 0.035) (Table 1). However, on several occasions during 15 yrs of sampling, both grids 11 and 12 experienced many months with no presence of antibody-positive deer mice (Luis et al. 2010). Among the three long-term live trapping grids we detected significant differences in each of the habitat variables except bare ground (Table 2). Of particular focus in this study, rock cover was greatest at grid 11 (0.556 %) and least at grid 12 (0.147 %; Table 2).</p>\r\n<p>We initially confirmed that the proportion of cover that consisted of rock was greater among sites we had selected as rocky sites, than non-rocky sites, in the short-term study (Table 3). Cover of most other habitat variables did not differ, except cover of lichens, which were found exclusively on rocks (Table 3). Over the 3-mo short-term study, 172 individual deer mice were captured 381 times in 1350 trap- nights. Deer mouse abundance was greatest at Hills One and Two and least abundant at Hill Three (Table 4). Average deer mouse abundance was higher at rocky sites than non-rocky sites but this difference was not statistically significant (Tables 4 and 5). The number of deer mice antibody positive for SNV and deer mouse antibody prevalence was unrelated to rocky or non-rocky habitat (Tables 4 and 5).</p>\r\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\r\n<p>Determining factors that influence zoonotic host abundance is important to understanding pathogen transmission, and subsequently human exposure risk. Here, we investigated if abundance of deer mice (a host reservoir for SNV) in a grassland</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article3Table1.jpg" alt="Table 1">\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article3Table2.jpg" alt="Table 2">\r\n<br>\r\n<p>ecosystem was related to availability of rock cover, i.e., as an indicator of potential refuge site availability, and if prevalence of SNV antibodies was positively related to deer mouse abundance between rocky and less rocky areas. Using long-term data from three live trapping grids, we found deer mice more abundant at a site with more rock cover, than sites with less rock cover over many years. Deer mice were on average more abundant at rocky sites in the short-term study, but this was a non-significant trend (P = 0.053). Based on the long-term study, we also found the number and prevalence of SNV antibody positive deer mice was greater at sites with more rock cover, than sites with less rock cover, which supported our hypothesis. Our short-term study did not detect a significant difference in SNV between sites with more or less rock cover, which could have been due to the short duration and relatively low number of deer mice trapped.</p>\r\n<p>Habitat characteristics varied among the three long-term grids in this study. This variation in habitat composition, in addition to rock cover, included moss, lichens, grasses, forbs, shrubs, and leaf litter. Among the three long-term grids, more deer mice were captured where cover of rocks, moss and lichens were high, and fewer were captured where cover of leaf litter, grasses and shrubs were high, suggesting these variables could all be determinants of deer mouse abundance in this grassland ecosystem. In previous work (Douglass 1989b) found a negative correlation between deer mouse abundance and grass cover. Douglass et al. (2001) also reported deer mice to be more abundant in sagebrush habitats in Montana. Shrubs in the current study area were mostly snowberry (<em>Symphoricarpus</em> spp.) with a growth form quite different from (particularly density of stems over the ground) sage. Collectively, our study, Douglass (1989b), and Douglass et al. (2001) indicated that deer mice are captured in less complex habitat matrices. We focused on rock cover as a source of variation in deer mouse abundance because of rock cover''s potential use as retreat sites by deer mice. While releasing deer mice after capture we often observed them seeking refuge under rocks. In this grassland environment other types of retreat sites (such as logs and thick shrub cover) are absent or rare.</p>\r\n<p>The habitat composition in our short- term study only differed by rock cover and lichens (which were observed on rocks only) among rocky and non-rocky grids. However, deer mice were generally but not statistically significantly so, more abundant at rocky grids. Our long-term study demonstrated that the number of deer mice with SNV antibodies and SNV antibody prevalence was higher on the grid with greater deer mouse abundance. This lends support to our hypothesis linking rock cover, host</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article3Table3.jpg" alt="Table 3">\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article3Table4.jpg" alt="Table 4">\r\n<br>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article3Table5.jpg" alt="Table 5">\r\n<br>\r\n<p>abundance and pathogen abundance in this grassland ecosystem. This relationship suggests that SNV prevalence is positively related to deer mouse abundance, which is consistent with some studies (e.g., Calisher et al. 1999, Yates et al. 2002, Carver et al. 2011a, and Madhav et al. 2007 and Carver et al. 2011b in a delayed density fashion).</p>\r\n<p>Transmission of SNV is horizontal due to intraspecific interactions among deer mice, such as aggressive encounters (Mills et al. 1997, Root et al. 1999, Botten et al. 2002). Intraspecific interactions among deer mice may increase with increasing abundance, resulting in increased transmission events.</p>\r\n<p>Our short-term study did not detect a relationship of deer mouse abundance with the number of SNV antibody positive individuals. Our short-term grids were only 0.25-ha in size (consisting of 25 Sherman live traps each), which limited the number  of deer mice that could be trapped compared to the numbers captured on the larger long- term grids. Given the size of trapping grids, the lack of detectable differences in SNV at rocky and non-rocky grids may be due to study design. Conducting this short-term, spatially replicated study for a longer period of time and with one hectare trapping grids may enable better detection of relationships between 1-ha rock cover, deer mouse abundance and SNV among deer mice across this grassland landscape.</p>\r\n<p>Other habitat characteristics can also function as sources of retreat sites to deer mice, particularly in other habitat types, leading to variation in abundance and infection. Douglass et al. (2001) found deer mouse abundance and SNV prevalence  was greater in sagebrush habitat (where deer mice may use sagebrush as retreat sites) than grassland and forest habitats in western Montana. Root et al. (1999) found abundance of deer mice and the number of SNV positive individuals to be greater at a site dominated with sagebrush/juniper/pine than a site with oak/mixed grass /forbs in western Colorado. Lehmer et al. (2008), in a brief study, found deer mice were on average more abundant and with higher SNV prevalence at sites with less mechanical (off road vehicle) anthropogenic disturbance in the Great Basin Desert, Utah. However,  in general, deer mice have been found to increase in numbers when habitats were opened by grazing (Smith 1940, Douglass and Frisina 1993, Matlack et al. 2001, Johnson and Anthony 2008) and forest treatments (Sullivan 1979, Douglass et al. 1999).</p>\r\n<p>Our informal observations indicate that deer mice use rocks as retreat sites throughout the year. However, variation in deer mouse abundance across this landscape is likely related to a complex combination  of habitat, climatic, and density dependant variables (i.e., Luis et al. 2010). It is also possible that at certain times of the year predators, such as weasels and snakes during summer months, may influence use of rocks by deer mice. Future spatially replicated analyses of other significant relationships among habitat characteristics and deer mouse abundance, particularly using multiple long-term studies, would  be valuable to delineate all the underlying habitat determinants in this grassland ecosystem landscape. Studies evaluating interactions among retreat site use, other fauna and climatic factors would also be valuable. Telemetry studies (Douglass 1989a) and food habit studies (Van Horne 1982) would be valuable approaches to accurately determine how deer mice use this grassland habitat.</p>\r\n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>\r\n<p>We thank the private ranch owner at Cascade for allowing us access to his property.

Twelve experimental 9-day trials were conducted over the course of the study. During these trials, mouse movements into buildings were monitored during three time periods (each 3 days in length). In the treatment plots these time periods corresponded to pre-grazing, grazing, and post grazing by horses. The number of individual deer mice entering buildings over time decreased in both the grazed and control plots during the 9 days of each experiment. The number of entrances per/individual among the pre-grazing, grazing and post grazing periods was different between control and treated plots for both males and females. The distribution   of entrances/individual among the three periods differed between males and females in both grazed and control plots. The habitat modification caused by grazing appeared to reduce\r\ndeer mouse activity (entrances/individual) in buildings but does not affect the number of   mice entering buildings. Reducing vegetative cover by grazing or mowing may not affect the number of mice investigating small structures but grazing creates different activity patterns in the structures for neighboring deer mice.\r\n', NULL, '<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<p>Ecological and environmental changes due to changing land use practices may provide opportunities for increased transmission of infectious diseases (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005) by increasing human contact with zoonotic hosts, their ectoparasites, and the diseases they carry. Rodents, such as deer mice (<em>Peromyscus maniculatus</em>), are reservoir hosts for many infectious diseases, including hantaviruses (Morse 1995). Hantaviruses\r\nare rodent-borne pathogens that can cause serious human illnesses. In the United States, the deer mouse is the principal reservoir for Sin Nombre virus (SNV) (family Bunyaviridae, genus <em>Hantavirus</em>) (Childs et al 1994, Nichol et al. 1993). SNV causes Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) a serious human illness with a fatality rate of 35 percent (CDC). In many HPS cases, human exposure to SNV has been linked to contact with infected rodents and/ or their excreta in and around buildings (peridomestic settings) (Armstrong et al. 1995). However, the ecology of deer mice in peridomestic settings is not well understood (Kuenzi and Douglass 2009, Kuenzi et al.\r\n2001), and little data exist on what causes deer mice to move from surrounding natural areas into peridomestic settings.</p>\r\n<p>Modification of surrounding habitat is one factor that may cause mice to enter buildings. Livestock grazing is probably the most common habitat modification in Montana. Small mammal populations and\r\ncommunities can be directly and indirectly affected by grazing (Hayward et al. 1997). Trampling of burrows, compacting soil, and competition for food resources are direct effects of grazing, while altering vegetation structure that then influences habitat selection by small mammals is an indirect effect. Significant changes in the nutritional dynamics and physical structure of vegetation have been caused by grazing by both bison and cattle (Damhoureyeh and Hartnett 1997) and presumably horses. Such alterations could potentially cause deer mice to leave their normal habitat and enter peridomestic settings.</p>\r\n<p>In an effort to improve our understanding of the relationship between anthropogenic environmental changes and human exposure to SNV, we examined the movement of deer mice into peridomestic settings in response to habitat modification (grazing). We hypothesized that grazing in areas around buildings would increase deer mice movement into those buildings. To test this hypothesis we monitored deer mouse movements into simulated buildings before, during, and after grazing by horses in the surrounding habitat. We used horses to graze the surrounding habitat because they were easier to control and move than cattle. The results from this study are necessary for the development of recommendations to help reduce the risk of human exposure to rodent borne diseases.</p>\r\n<h2>Methods</h2>\r\n<h3>Study Site</h3>\r\n<p>This study was conducted near Gregson, Silver Bow County, Montana. The dominant vegetation at the study site consisted of antelope bitterbrush (<em>Purshia tridentata</em>), spotted knapweed (<em>Centaurea maculosa</em>), cheatgrass (<em>Bromus tectorum</em>), and big sagebrush (<em>Artemisia tridentata</em>).</p>\r\n<h3>Rodent Trapping and Processing</h3>\r\n<p>We conducted 12 experimental trials (9 days each) from April through June 2005; October through November 2005; February 2006; June through August 2007; and May through July 2008. Deer mice were trapped and marked 3 days prior to each trial. In each plot we attempted to saturate the plot with traps set in grids containing (see experimental design below), five rows of 25 traps (Sherman non-folding, aluminum life traps (8 x 9 x 23 cm, H.B. Sherman Trap Co., Tallahassee, Florida, USA), with 10-m spacing between traps, were set with the experimental buildings in the center of the grid, and checked each day for 3 consecutive days. Traps were baited with peanut butter and oatmeal and contained polyester bedding. All captured animals  were transported to a central location for processing. Species, body mass, sex, age, and reproductive condition of captured animals were recorded. Deer mice were ear- tagged with monel #1005-1 tags (National Band and Tag Co., Newport, Kentucky). PIT tags (Passive integrated transponder tags, BioMark, Inc; Boise, Idaho) were adhered directly to the skin between the shoulders of each deer mouse. A small patch of fur was shaved away to secure the PIT tag closer to the animal. The adhesive was then used to coat over the PIT tag and glue the surrounding fur over the tag to help with  tag retention. Based on modifications to methods used in previous work, (Kuenzi et al 2005) we assumed pit tag retention was nearly 100 percent for the duration of each trial. A hand held reader was used to verify that the PIT tags functioned after attachment. PIT tag numbers were then recorded and individuals were released at the point of capture.</p>\r\n<h3>Experimental Design</h3>\r\n<p>The effects of habitat modification (by grazing) on mouse entries into buildings and availability of food resources (rolled oats) within buildings were examined using a series of 12 experimental trials. For each trial, one treatment (grazing) plot and one control (no grazing) plot (0.6 ha) were used. Two small simulated buildings were placed in the center of each plot. Each simulated building was 2.44 m x 1.22 m x 1.22 m  with a 5-cm diameter opening in one end.\r\nOur simulated buildings do not represent all features that actual outbuildings would present to mice; however, we feel the initial response by mice to simulated buildings would be similar to that of actual buildings. Further experimentation would be required to determine what would allow deer mice to establish residency in buildings. One building in each plot contained ~ 1 kg of rolled oats. An electrical fence was constructed around treatment pastures to control horses.</p>\r\n<p>We equipped each building with a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag transceiver (Model 2001F, Biomark Inc, Boise, Idaho) linked to an antenna located around the building opening. The antenna detected pit-tagged deer mice that entered/ exited the building. The pit tag number, date and time of the entrance/exit were recorded in the transceiver. Transceivers in each building were activated in the evening and turned off every morning to conserve electricity. Each transceiver was powered by a 12-volt deep cycle battery charged by a solar panel. Transceivers were retrieved from the field in the morning and data from the previous night were downloaded onto\r\na desktop computer. Movement into these buildings was monitored for 9 nights during each experimental trial.</p>\r\n<p>Buildings in both the treatment and control plots were monitored 3 days prior to introducing the horses (pre-grazing). Both plots were monitored for 3 days with the horses in the treatment plot (grazing) and then monitored again for 3 days after the horses were moved out (post grazing). Six horses were used to graze each experimental plot.   The horses basically removed all herbaceous vegetation (to within 2 cm of the soil) within the three days they were present in the treatment plots. All plots had an entire winter and growing season between trials.</p>\r\n<h3>Data Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>To determine if habitat modification by grazing would affect deer mouse entrances into our simulated buildings, we used Chi- square analyses (Zar 1984) to compare the numbers of individuals entering buildings (a numeric response) and the number of entrances/individual (a behavioral response) during the pre-grazing, grazing and post grazing periods between the control and grazed pastures summed across all trials. A P-value of 0.05 was used for all analyses.\r\n<p>It was logistically difficult to spatially replicate this experiment due to the large area necessary, a limited supply of horses, and the home range size of deer mice. Therefore, this experiment was replicated by performing multiple (N = 12) experimental trials. The location of treatment and control plots were randomized among a set of pastures within a single ranch. Accordingly, the 12 experimental trials were conducted over a relatively long period (Apr 2005 to Jul 2008) to enhance the independence of observations, i.e., reduce the probability that individual mice would become habituated to the experiment.</p>\r\n<h2>Results</h2>\r\n<p>Of the 174 deer mice fitted with PIT tags, 69 (39.7%) entered buildings at least once. Out of these 69 individuals, only four individuals entered buildings on all 9 days of a given trial. Across all trials and plots, 63 of the 69 individual mice entered buildings during the pre-grazing period,  42 during grazing period and 32 during the post grazing period. Some individual mice were recorded during multiple periods and\r\nwere included in the number of individuals/ period.</p>\r\n<p>Across all trials in the treatment plots, we recorded a total of 26 individual mice entering buildings with 24 individuals entering during the pre-grazing period, 18 during the grazing period, and 14 during the post grazing period (Fig. 1). In the control plots across all trials, 43 individuals entered buildings with 39 mice entering the buildings during the pre-grazing period, 24 during the grazing period, and 18 during the post grazing period. Regardless of treatment, the number of mice entering the buildings was greatest during the first 3 days of the trial (pre-grazing period) and smallest during the last 3 days of each trial (post grazing period; Fig. 1). The number of individuals entering buildings among periods was similar between control and treated pastures (&#967;<sup>2</sup> = 0.017, P > 0.05) (Fig. 1) with the number of individuals entering buildings declining in both control and treatment plots over the 9 days of a trial. In control plots 18 individual deer mice accounted  for 87 percent of movements into buildings whereas nine individuals accounted for 70 percent of the movements into buildings.</p>\r\n \r\n<figure>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article4Figure1.jpg" alt="Figure1">\r\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> The number of deer mice entering simulated buildings in grazed versus control (non-grazed) plots in Southwestern Montana from 2005 through 2008.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The behavioral response (number of entrances/individual) was significantly different between control and grazed plots for both females (&#967;<sup>2</sup> = 7.68, P < 0.05) and males (&#967;<sup>2</sup> = 95.68, P < 0.001; Fig. 2). The number of female entrances into buildings in grazed plots decreased over 9 days but remained fairly constant in the control plots. Male entrances also decreased in the grazed plots but increased in the control plots from one period to the next.\r\n<p>Males and females responded differently in terms of numbers of entrances per individual through the duration of a trial in both the grazed plots (&#967;<sup>2</sup> = 12.38, P < 0.05) and the control plots (&#967;<sup>2</sup> = 26.36, P < 0.001; Fig. 3). However, overall responses differed in the grazed plots compared to the control plots. Both female and male entrances decreased over the nine days in the grazed plots with males decreasing more than females. In the control plots, male entrances/ individual increased during the nine days while female entrances remained relatively constant. Most animals in the experiments were adults thus sample sizes were insufficient to test age related responses and sample sizes were insufficient for seasonal comparisons.</p>\r\n<p>The presence of food had no effect on entrances/individual in the grazed plots (food vs. no food, &#967;<sup>2</sup> = 1.68 P > 0.05).\r\nHowever in the control, entrances/individual increased continuously in the building with food and remained fairly constant in the building with no food over the nine days\r\n(&#967;<sup>2</sup> = 17.67, P < 0. 001; Fig. 4).</p>\r\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\r\n<p>Research on the effects of livestock grazing on deer mouse ecology has yielded various results for different vegetation types (Douglass and Frisina 1993, Clary and Medin 1992, Medin and Clary 1989,\r\nOldemeyer and Allen-Johnson 1988). In this study we found no difference in the number of individuals entering buildings in grazed versus ungrazed plots. Our movement data are consistent with Oldemeyer and Allen- Johnson (1988), who found little or no difference in deer mice abundance between grazed and ungrazed sites with dominant vegetation types of spotted knapweed, antelope bitterbrush, and cheatgrass.</p>\r\n <br>\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article4Figure2.jpg" alt="Figure1">\r\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> The number of entrances/individual mice into simulated buildings located in control (non-grazed) versus grazed plots in Southwest Montana from 2005 through 2008.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n <br>\r\n<p>In our study, the number of mice entering simulated buildings declined over the 9-day period of each experimental trial. This reduction in numbers over time was most evident in the control plots of the  study in the absence grazing, suggesting  that the longer mice had access to buildings, the less the mice were "inclined" to enter them. Fewer mice may have entered over the duration of the study possibly because after initial investigations, they found the simulated buildings unsuitable or they may have left the area entirely.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>However, we detected activity to differ between control and grazed plots for both males and female deer mice, as represented by number of entrances into buildings per individual. Activity decreased over the 9-day duration of experimental trials in the grazed plots but in the control plots it remained fairly constant for females and increased for males (Fig. 3). In grazed plots deer mice may possibly have been using a new\r\nresource, e.g., seed in horse manure, instead of entering buildings or the mice hesitated to move across open areas to access the</p>\r\n <br>\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article4Figure3.jpg" alt="Figure1">\r\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Response of female versus male deer mice to grazing expressed as the number of entrances/individual mice into simulated buildings located in control (non-grazed) versus grazed plots in Southwest Montana from 2005 through 2008.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n <br>\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src="../meta/img/Article4Figure4.jpg" alt="Figure1">\r\n<figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Effects of food in simulated buildings on the distribution of entrances/ individual deer mouse in non-grazed pastures in Southwest Montana from 2005 through 2008.

The increase in activity by males in the control plots may have been due to the presence of food in one of the buildings. In a previous study, presence of food significantly increased activity represented by entrances into buildings (Kuenzi and Douglass 2009). However, the effect of food only occurred in the control plots and not in grazed plots. Why male activity would increase and female activity did not is unclear. Perhaps males could shift activity to the new food resource more easily than females that may have had litters in nests some distance from the buildings. </p>\r\n<p>Previous research has shown that adult males are the most likely to become infected with SNV (Douglass et al. 2007) as well as to disperse (Lonner et al. 2008). If males are more likely to enter or are more active in peridomestic systems upon sylvan disturbance (grazing in this instance) than females, grazing could increase chances for human exposure to SNV. However, grazing did not increase the number of either males or females entering buildings but did modify the behavioral response (number of entrances/individual). The males increased activity in buildings located in the control plots during the duration of the trials but decreased activity into buildings located in the grazed plots. This may indicate that grazing in small areas around buildings may reduce human exposure to SNV in buildings.</p>\r\n<p>The simulated buildings do not replicate all resources presented to deer mice in normal houses, barns and sheds. Normal buildings are much more complex, larger and provide places for nesting, hiding and caching food. The resources provided by normal buildings would affect how deer mice used the buildings once the outside environment was modified differently than our simulated buildings did. However, the simulated buildings do provide insight into the initial response (entering) of deer mice to habitat modification surrounding buildings.</p>\r\n<p>Information on factors that draw mice into buildings is necessary to better understand the relationship between peridomestic and sylvan settings. This understanding is necessary to design proper health measures to protect humans from SNV. More research, perhaps with more severe and expansive habitat modification than was created by a few days of grazing and more complex buildings is necessary to clarify the influences of habitat modification on deer mice entering buildings. However, our preliminary results suggested that grazing may reduce activity of male mice in buildings.</p>\r\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\r\n<p>Special thanks are due to Hank, Maggie, Abby, Emily, and Jay Peterson and Susan LaRue for unlimited access to their property as well as the use and transportation of their horses.

These measures are aimed at reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions, while allowing wildlife to cross the road. In fenced road sections, gaps for side roads are mitigated by wildlife guards (similar to cattle guards). We focused on a 1-km fenced section where animals can either cross the road using five crossing structures (4 culverts, 1 bridge), or they can access the road through two guards on the east side and cross using jump-outs, i.e., earthen ramps that allow animals in fenced areas to jump down to safety, on the west side. We monitored wildlife movements with cameras at the two guards and in one large crossing structure adjacent to a guard. We investigated how effective these guards are in keeping deer (<em>Odocoileus</em> spp.) from accessing the road. We also compared movements across a guard to those through a crossing structure. The guards were 85 percent or more effective in keeping deer from accessing the road, and 93.5 percent of deer used the crossing structure instead of an adjacent guard when crossing the road. Though the guards were not an absolute barrier to deer, the results indicated that deer were substantially discouraged from crossing the guards, and the vast majority crossed the road using the crossing structure rather than the guard, indicating that guards are an effective means of mitigation.\r\n', NULL, NULL, '<p>Montana Chapter Of The Wildlife Society 49St Annual Meeting</p>\r\n<p>Multiplying Human Impacts Bordering Open Space: Challenges For Wildlife Habitat And Connectivity Protection</p>\r\n<p>February 22-25, 2011 Missoula, Montana</p>\r\n<p>General Abstracts</p>\r\n<p>Alphabetical By First Author''s Last Name (* Denotes Presenter)</p>\r\n\r\n', 'Abstracts', 'Biological Sciences - Terrestrial', 'Academic Journal', 'Academic Journal', 'Wildlife crossing', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2015-10-02 15:52:50', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Using motion-sensored cameras eliminates the human factor and allows wildlife to behave more naturally. Another important issue that wildlife conflict managers come across is not having enough time in the day. Our study used remote upload- ing, wireless wildlife cameras to help biologists involved in conflict management situations with grizzly bears (<em>Ursus arctos horribilis</em>). The biologists were able to easily set up the cameras near residents who had complained of grizzly bears damaging property. Having the cameras automatically upload pictures allowed the biologist to observe the wildlife conflicts and the status of the deterrent measures from a remote location. The biologists could view the pictures almost immediately through their email and know what was occurring at the site. If there was a trap or deterrent set up, the biologist could see whether an animal was caught and needed to be removed, or could similarly observe that the trap was empty and would save themselves a trip to the site.

Research on a mountain-dwelling mammal species across 15 yrs of contemporary data and historical records from 1898-1956 suggest that pace of local extinctions and rate of upslope retraction have been markedly more rapid and governed by markedly different dynamics in the last decade than during the 20th century. This may mean that understanding past dynamics of species losses may not always help predict patterns of future loss. Given the importance of clinal variability and ecotypic variation, phenotypic plasticity, behavioral plasticity, and variation in climatic conditions, for widely-distributed species'' geographic ranges to be determined by different factors in different portions of their range is not uncommon. Consequently, greatest progress in understanding distributional- change phenomena will occur with coordinated, landscape-scale research and monitoring.

Any restoration activity should include public education and outreach so that land-use decisions in the future do not compromise\r\nthe integrity of the ecosystems that support the region. We have developed a program, the Bird''s-eye View Education Program, which integrates public education and research on the ecological health of the UCFRB. Specifically we focus on birds, inviting the public\r\nto observe research at songbird banding stations and Osprey (<em>Pandion haliaetus</em>) nests. Riparian-associated birds are likely to respond positively to riparian restoration activities and can be used as bio-indicators to measure success. In 2010 we operated three bird banding stations and monitored 19 Osprey nests. We captured 595 songbirds, collected 43 blood and feather samples from Osprey chicks, and served nearly 1000 participants. The program was an outstanding success and results from an assessment show that participants leave with a positive attitude toward the outdoor science experience and a general knowledge of Upper Clark Fork restoration, history, and its riparian ecosystems.\r\n', NULL, NULL, '<p>Montana Chapter Of The Wildlife Society 49St Annual Meeting</p>\r\n<p>Multiplying Human Impacts Bordering Open Space: Challenges For Wildlife Habitat And Connectivity Protection</p>\r\n<p>February 22-25, 2011 Missoula, Montana</p>\r\n<p>General Abstracts</p>\r\n<p>Alphabetical By First Author''s Last Name (* Denotes Presenter)</p>', 'Abstracts', 'Biological Sciences - Terrestrial', 'Academic Journal', 'Academic Journal', 'Clark Fork River#Conservation', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2015-10-02 15:58:16', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

While population restoration, augmentation, and introductions have traditionally been the predominant conservation activities associated with these species in Montana, basic ecological research has been limited. A new research initiative has been developed and funded to study bighorn sheep and mountain goat spatial and population ecology in a number of ecological settings within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The aspiration of the collaborators is to develop a long-term research program that could expand to other populations of these species in Montana if we are successful. Primary objectives of the studies include 1) understanding   the ecological interactions between sympatric populations, 2) developing and refining habitat suitability models, 3) documenting spatial dynamics within and among populations and identifying important movement corridors, 4) collecting vital rate data to better understand population dynamics, and 5) investigating potential responses of bighorn sheep and\r\nmountain goats to gradual changes in the regional climate. The presentation will describe the collaboration and ongoing efforts to consolidate all available data on bighorn sheep and mountain goats in the GYE.

Here we replicate their analyses considering only those years in which field monitoring was consistent, and we consider the effect of annual variation in recruitment on wolf population growth. We also use model selection to evaluate models of recruitment and human-caused mortality rates in wolf populations in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Using data from 27 area-years of intensive wolf monitoring, we show that variation in both recruitment and human-caused mortality affect annual wolf population growth rates and that human-caused mortality rates have increased with the sizes of wolf populations. We also show that either recruitment rates have decreased with population sizes or that the ability of current field resources to document recruitment rates has recently become less successful as the number of wolves in the region has increased. Predictions of wolf population growth in Montana from our top models are consistent with field observations and estimates previously made by MFWP.

We used an empirical approach to model connectivity of a landscape based on resource selection of free-ranging GPS-collared greater sage-grouse (<em>Centrocercus urophasianus</em>) in a natural gas field in central Wyoming.\r\nWe analyzed resource selection during three movement states (encamped, traveling, and relocating) and incorporated turning angle to identify features that functioned as barriers or conduits to movement. To illustrate application of the results we used the resource selection model to create spatially-explicit predictive maps identifying areas that generally provided large amounts of high quality ''movement habitat.'' We found that both males and females selected for vegetation variables at multiple spatial scales. When traveling or relocating, males and females tended to avoid natural gas and oil wells and associated infrastructure and avoided areas with high topographic roughness within 800m. High topographic roughness \r\nwas a barrier for traveling males. Relocating females were more likely to travel in a straight direction through areas of high road density and steep slopes. The predictive maps\r\nvalidated well using independent GPS location data. These results provide insight into habitat preferences of sage-grouse and can be used for both general and site-specific guidance on identifying habitats preferred or avoided during moderate and long distance movements of sage-grouse.

We designed our study to estimate occupancy rates and detection probability among owl territories in four areas: Zion and Capitol Reef National Parks, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and Cedar Mesa. A primary objective was to estimate the potential effects of human recreation on occupancy of the owl territories ("sites"). In addition to occupancy, we estimated reproductive status. Preliminary results from our data analysis showed varying occupancy rates, with 83 percent occupancy at mesic sites (Zion and Cedar Mesa), and 43 percent at xeric sites (Capitol Reef and GSENM). Detection probability was estimated to be 89 percent. Human use did not appear to reduce occupancy or detection.

Variation in prey use among wolf packs was most influenced by accessibility to deer, vulnerability of moose, and genetic admixture, and mediated by winter progression.

As a result, western societies have eliminated or greatly reduced many traditional uses of Pb, including many paints, gasoline and solders because of threats to the health of humans and the environment.

We collected bi-weekly observations of elk (<em>Cervus elaphus</em>) number and distributions across  the winter range from 1988-2007. Using a matched-case control logistic regression model\r\nto estimate selection coefficients, we evaluated the effects of annual green-up conditions, winter conditions, landscape features, and grazing treatment on elk resource selection within the grazing system. We found that within the grazing system, elk preferentially selected for rested pastures over pastures that were grazed the previous summer. The strength of selection against the pasture grazed during the growing season was strongest, and pastures grazed during the early and late summer were selected for over the pasture grazed during the growing  season. The number of elk utilizing the grazing system increased in the 19 years following implementation of the grazing system; however, total elk herd size also increased during this time. We found no evidence that the proportion of the elk herd utilizing the grazing system changed following implementation of the rest-rotation grazing system.

The need and opportunity to implement public harvest in 2008, 2009, and 2010 required Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) to develop a stepped down adaptive management framework specific to harvest. For 2008 and 2009, FWP set modest objectives: implement\r\na harvest, maintain a recovered population, and begin the learning process to inform development of future hunting regulations and quotas. In 2010, FWP used a formal Structured Decision Making Process to more clearly define priorities and challenges of setting a wolf season, outline objectives of a successful season, and evaluate consequences and trade-offs between alternative management actions. For all years, FWP used a modeling process to simulate a wide range of harvest rates across three harvest units and to predict harvest effects on the minimum number of wolves, packs and breeding pairs. Model inputs were derived  from minimum wolf numbers observed in the field. Modeling allowed consideration of a range of harvest quotas, predicted outcomes, and risk that harvest could drive the population below federally-required minimums. It also facilitated explicit consideration of how well a particular quota achieved objectives and how to adapt future regulations and quotas. Legal challenges to federal delisting restricted implementation of the first fair chase hunting season to 2009. Montana''s wolf population is securely recovered, despite the dynamic political and legal environments.

We used structured interviews of wildlife biologists and managers that work with moose to document current moose management in Montana. Most biologists reported that moose were stable or decreasing in their areas of responsibility. Predation was the most common concern for factors limiting moose, followed by habitat succession, hunter harvest, disease and parasites, Native American harvest, and habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation. In addition to information from post-season surveys of moose permit holders, biologists assessed moose populations using information from a variety of sources including landowner reports, hunter reports collected at check stations, unadjusted trend counts, bull: cow ratios, recruitment ratios, sightability-corrected population estimates and habitat condition. Nearly all respondents felt that available information was inadequate in various ways for making moose management decisions. Clearly identified research needs include calibration of currently employed moose population indices to actual trends in moose populations, development of a survey program that will provide better and more moose survey data at the appropriate scale for management decisions, and research into how predation, habitat, disease, parasites, and climate affect moose survival and recruitment rates.\r\n', NULL, NULL, '<p>Montana Chapter Of The Wildlife Society 49St Annual Meeting</p>\r\n<p>Multiplying Human Impacts Bordering Open Space: Challenges For Wildlife Habitat And Connectivity Protection</p>\r\n<p>February 22-25, 2011 Missoula, Montana</p>\r\n<p>General Abstracts</p>\r\n<p>Alphabetical By First Author''s Last Name (* Denotes Presenter)</p>', 'Abstracts', 'Biological Sciences - Terrestrial', 'Academic Journal', 'Academic Journal', 'Moose', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2015-10-02 16:07:20', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Hg concentrations observed within an aquatic food web are controlled by two factors, a source of inorganic mercury and the potential for that Hg to become methylated (methylation controlled by environmental conditions i.e.: water velocity, organic matter, etc.). A sufficient source of inorganic mercury and environmental conditions which promote Hg methylation can lead to maximum MeHg biomagnification. This study presents a comprehensive look at food web Hg biomagnification within the CFRB. Hg concentrations are characterized through blood or tissue samples from osprey, fish, and aquatic macroinvertebrates. Additionally we look at controlling Hg biomagnification factors, Hg of fine-grained sediment, percentage of wetlands and riparian land cover, and mean monthly discharge, to access the biomagnification process within the watershed and thus the Hg levels observed throughout these three trophic levels.

Temporary emigration rates and recruitment rates were state- and age-dependent and annually variable. For seals that attended reproductive colonies the previous year, mean TE rates decreased from 0.98 (sd = 0.02) at\r\nage 1 to 0.15 (sd = 0.16) at age 8, whereas mean recruitment rates increased from 0.06 (sd\r\n= 0.03) at age 5 to 0.52 (sd= 0.16) at age 10. Seals that did not attend reproductive colonies the previous year had greater TE rates and lower recruitment rates than seals that did attend colonies, but the confidence interval for the effect of TE on recruitment included zero. Our results suggest that 1) motivation to emigrate varies temporally depending on environmental conditions, 2) as seals grow older they have increased motivation to attend reproductive colonies even before they are ready to recruit, and 3) some seals appear to always be more likely than others to emigrate.

We found a strong genetic signal for a 90 percent contraction in effective population size of fisher and estimated that this decline occurred over a thousand years ago.

Next, I tested the hypothesis that survival of adult female migrant and resident elk differs over time first, as a function of density and second, as a function of seasonal variation between summer and winter.

Migrants had twice the variation in survival rates and a greater   risk of death during summer compared to residents.

Preliminary analysis demonstrated high individual variation in pup mass within a season and modest variation among seasons suggesting that pup mass may be affected more by individual animal attributes than annual variation in environmental conditions. This variation in maternal investment was investigated using maternal traits taken from the long term database. We found that maternal traits have different affects on pup mass at different stages of investment. Maternal age and birth date were found to be influential on pre- and\r\npost-partum investment along with age at first reproduction on pre-natal investment and breeding status the previous year on post-natal investment. The variation in the influence of maternal traits on maternal investment may be due to the increased energy requirement of lactation and reproductive costs that females accrue throughout their lifetime.\r\n', NULL, NULL, '<p>Montana Chapter Of The Wildlife Society 49St Annual Meeting</p>\r\n<p>Multiplying Human Impacts Bordering Open Space: Challenges For Wildlife Habitat And Connectivity Protection</p>\r\n<p>February 22-25, 2011 Missoula, Montana</p>\r\n<p>Poster Session</p>\r\n<p>Alphabetical By First Author''s Last Name (* Denotes Presenter)</p>', 'Abstracts', 'Biological Sciences - Terrestrial Poster Session', 'Academic Journal', 'Academic Journal', 'Weddell seal', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2015-10-02 16:10:06', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
